Prolouge...

Your world has been taken over...
One day the depth of the underworld has crested open...
Monsters come out one by one slautering, kidnapping, and killing everyone they see...
They taken over the major towns...
You and a small group of survivors retreat into bunkers...
All of you can defend and protect each other, however... food is running low.
Everyone has their fair share, but all you have is your [weapon] and a few scraps left...
You are tired of rotting away, you tell yourself it's our turn to fight back!
Name: "I'm done..."

Another survivor: "Huh? Done with what?" 

name: "I am done with all this bullshit!" You hype yourself up and cause a scene
name: "I want to fight! I want to take back what is ours!" everyone stares as you stand.
name: "So who is with me!" No one responds back or says anything.
You get ready to leave which was always a option in the first place. 
You grab your [weapon] and walk near the exit of the bunker. 

Leader: He hesitates to let you out. "[name] are you sure you want to leave?" 

[yes/no]

no- You decide to change your mind and as you head back, you live the rest of your life
	until you starve to death and let someone eat you turning it inside a war in the bunker

yes- continue

Name: "Yes let me out" 

The leader opens the valut door quickly and as it shuts behinds you, you regret your decision
but it's too late to turn back now. You hear screeches echo through the forest and skys. 
You shake with fear and you look at your [weapon] and you have a choice still.

Should you just end yourself off by your own hands?

[yes/no]

yes- you commit suicide... game over

no - You suck it up and you aren't going to die without a fight. 

Chapter 1 - Scavanging 

You find yourself through a small neighborhood, you are hungry, half naked, and need a bag.

As you are walking in the broad day light, you see a small hell hound and it 
becomes hostiles. It wants to fight but it waits for you to make the first move.

//As you are fighting the amount of dmg you deal is based on three factors.
  How strong is your weapon, How high is your strenght, and If you deal a critical strike or not
  Weapons Dmg is based on the type of material it's made out of.
  There are different and unknown materials in this world now that has been brought by
  or made out of the monsters. 
  Your strength will naturally grow but some quests can help increase your overall skill
  Critical strikes will be based on both your stats and the weapon.//

//1 - ATTACK:
  Heavy attacks have a 25% chance to land a strike and deal a extra 125% dmg
  Normal attacks have a 50% chance to hit and deal monderate dmg

//2 - ANALYSIS:
  Take a turn to analysis your ENEMY's Stats such as HP, Dmg chance, or 
  any special effects such as burning, healing or poison. Recommend only
  using this on stronger unknown enemyies. 

//3 - ITEMS: 
  Spend a turn to use any ITEMS such as POTIONS, speical healing items,
  or any dmg boosters or magic spells. Once you use an item weither if
  it fails or succeeds, it is only a one time use... most of the time.

//4 - SELF CHECK:
  Quickly check yourself for any effects or if you just want to overall
  see how yourself is doing and what your stats are. This won't take up
  a turn no matter how many times you look at yourself.

//5 - FLEE: 
  If you think you have no chance in fighting an enemy or know you are 
  going to die, take a chance to run if it's the last enemy based on how
  high your DEX Skill. If it's a boss then you can not flee.

//6 - HELP:
  Need a reminder back to what everything means then you can type 6 for
  help. Disclaimer, in the future the stats will remain deault in help
  but to check actual stats use SELF CHECK

  Negate- 75% chance to avoide 25% of dmg
  Block- 50% chance to avoide 50% of dmg
  Dodge - 25% chance to take no dmg at all
  
  Armor - Heavier armor absorbs more dmg but has less 
 	  mobility to aovid attacks.
